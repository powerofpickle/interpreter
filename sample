#Idea 1
folder/item1 = "this is text"
link1 = &folder/item1
link2 = link1
delete(link1)
# output of link2 is still working
delete('folder/item1')
# now link2 is broken

folder/item1 = "this is a text"
link1 = &folder/item1
link1 = "something"
# link1 is no longer a link.


#Idea 2
folder/item1 = "this is text"
link1 = &folder/item1 # same as link("link1", "folder")
link2 = link1
delete(link1)
delete('folder/item1')
# link2 still contains the text because it was never really a link


#Idea 3 - functions only
my_function = (first, path_to_sth){
  [path_to_sth] = [first]
}

my_function(32, abspath("thing"))

folder/item1 = "this is a test"
link("link1", "folder/item1")

link2 = link1 # this is a link to link1
sth = link1 + link2
type(link1) #
